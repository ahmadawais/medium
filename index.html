Accessibility

_Core Ideas:_

Everyone needs to be able to access it,

Else it's not going on the website.

This includes:

Blind People.

Deaf People.

People with old computers.

People without _desktop_ computers

People with dial up.

People with motor issues.

This is not hard...

If you don't leave it to the end.

We don't bite, we want to help you be able to do this.

That being said we don't want to do it for you.

Teach a fish etc.

Usually this is your contractor's responsibility.

Patrick put it into the contract boilerplate. 

_Think web first._

We are supposed to be GreenDOT.

How To:

Add alt text to images as you make them.

Your software supports this.

Trust me it does.

Alt text serves in place of an image.

_Bad:_

A map showing cities by size in MA.

_Good:_

Boston is the biggest city in MA.

You can also tag images as background.

Scanned PDFs are a no-no.

Only Exceptions:

Letters physically mailed to us.

Documents that predate the digital era.

Not Excuses:

Documents your boss signed.

Documents that MassDEP sent you.

Always export to PDF or save as PDF

_Never print to PDF!_

Keep it under 4MB.

(If possible.)

If it's not a report appendix is almost always possible.

Excel

If you can't sort it, it's not accessible.

Power Point

If your using it to make something that's not a presentation, your using it wrong.

Your template needs to be accessible too.

Make sure your (alt tagged) graphics are sensibly sized.

Think really really hard before letting your contractor make an 80 slide presentation.

_Tips:_

Keep it simple.

The visual flourishes, not the content are often the problem.

Make it right first, then make it pretty.

Touch base with us _before_ you start making it.

"_I need the report I spent 8 months on made accessible and posted COB today._" Will not make me your friend.

It's hard/impossible to fix a document already PDFed.

If I'm going to help you I need the original.

If your exporting to pdf and then bringing those PDFs into a document you plan on making into a PDF, stop and come talk to me.
